        Jenny Odell, in "How to Internet", cycles through a plethora of digital
        media that have forged a sort of "randomized" connection between people
        all over the world. However, this sort of wonder that she and many
        others have experienced from using the Internet to connect to others is
        but a temporary window of what the Internet now is. Odell relates this
        to the changing relationship between "The Internet" and different
        generations of people, shifting from understanding the Internet as
        something that acts as an extension of our regular lives to a whole
        different world of networks and digital spaces. My website is a shifting
        house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be? After reading
        this article I can finally understand the question, though still lack an
        answer. Laurel Schwulst enlists the power of humanity's sixth sense
        (metaphors) to shape the meaning and purpose of a website and the role
        that each site has as a strand of the spider web that is the Internet.
        As Laurel describes the website as finite spaces such as a house, room,
        or shelf (something that I'm sure Q enjoyed, with their background in
        architecture), the confines of what a website is and disappear. A
        website does not need one purpose to be good, neither does it need to be
        "done" or "finished" or simply act as an archive for an artist's work,
        it is whatever you want it to be. Molly Soda's website is a phenomenal
        example of what Laurel Schwulst was talking about. It's reminiscent of a
        cluttered room or the inside of one's brain or even a trash can of
        sorts. Taking all these into consideration, I can clearly sense Molly's
        personality from the site. Inside this collection of internet junk,
        there is a non-linear narrative, through hidden links to other sites and
        screenshots and ads with text. There is a distinct sense of humour
        throughout the entire site (throwback to Jenny Odell's piece where she
        carefully quotes “You literally gotta put some humor into it and just
        like, chill the fuck out,”). I can't help but laugh at the text that
        says "This Is Not A Joke" and the variety of comments stating things
        such as "if only you were as interesting in real life". The title of the
        site only adds to it, showing "does this seem more professional?". My
        personal favourite, however, is her CV which you can access by clicking
        the text that says "Would you like to see my CV?" and then proceeds to
        take you to a neon yellow Google doc that lists out her (impressive) CV
        in Arial font. 1. Is it possible to revive the mundane and "random"
        aspects of the Internet from before? Can we still form these types of
        connections on today's Internet? 2. How do designers and creators of
        websites for corporations play into this? To what extent does their work
        on a certain website show the identity of the company or themselves? 3.
        Websites like Molly Soda's can be hard to digest to certain audiences
        (like professional companies though that is the very things she is
        making fun of), while artist and those interested in the field find
        important narratives within her work. Should we be trying to bridge this
        gap? To make this mindset about digital spaces more accessible to
        greater audiences? Though art should never change itself just to become
        more "digestible", will our digital society ever progress if these
        creations and perspectives are kept to people who already appreciate
        work like Molly Soda's?

        In "Archiving a Revolution in the Digital Age, Archiving as an Act of
        Resistance", Lara Baladi discusses #Jan25, the 2011 uprisings in Egypt
        against the current government and President Mubarak. She emphasizes the
        importance of media in this revolution (both during and years after the
        event occurred) and how the sharing of media has become the tipping
        point for the Egyptian public to begin creating more videos, photo, and
        art, especially focused towards the uprisings. Examples that Baladi used
        include the Tahrir Cinema and various street art/graffiti projects.
        Urgentcraft is a practice that Paul Soulellis developed that positions
        art and design within social movements, queerness, and capitalism (among
        others). He discusses his own experiences with this, starting from his
        experiences as a white gay man. It is through the many queer movements
        in the late 20th century that allows Soulellis first see the role of art
        and design in protests and movements. He discovers the "slow approach to
        fast making" and that queerness is not necessarily this radical idea but
        a desire and view of a different future. He talks about projects of his
        as well as other artists that reflect the ideas of Urgentcraft from
        queerness to illegibility to digital archiving. He finishes his talk by
        urgent the viewers and the audience to practice Urgentcraft as well,
        providing them with 18 guiding statements. 1. How has protest and
        rebellion developed in a digital world as compared to how the world has
        been so far? 2. What does digital archival work (especially when
        pertaining to sensitive topics) look like in societies where the
        Internet is intensely censored by the government? 3. How much of social
        media can be counted as "Urgentcraft"? What about sensations like public
        disinformation and fake news?

        The Internet will never truly make sense to me, although I now know
        about the servers and wires that make it work. What honestly astounded
        me was seeing how far the Internet has grown from its conception. With
        over 4 billion users it's crazy how half of the entire world is now
        connected in one form or another. It's also interesting to point out,
        however, that so much of the Internet is controlled by a select few
        corporations. Nevertheless, the Internet has certainly grown from when
        it was simply meant for military use and it has revolutionized the world
        along the way.

        "User Experience" or UX is a term coined by Don Norman in 1993. The term
        itself is used to express a person interactions and experiences with a
        system. In practice, user experience "scripts the user" by making the
        user forget that there are computers or algorithms. This idea is also
        called "user illusion". Moving along, the article discusses the
        desktopization of war. This is different than the gamification of war,
        the intent is not to "win" the game or to kill more, but to feel fine
        after the job is done. This comes from simplification of images such as
        simplifying human appearances in effort to dehumanize them as well as
        using generated works to augment a person's view of the real world.
        Before GUI, there was blackness. Where computers displayed green command
        line interface on a black background. But when GUI was commercialized on
        Apple's Lisa, the interface became white and instead of command lines,
        there were folders and windows. Though white GUI is what we are most
        used to now, it goes beyond saying that the UX and UI of today's
        computers was grown from Blackness. In what ways are "old" UX designers
        different from "new" designers? Is one better than the other? What does
        the future of the desktopization and gamification of war look like? How
        would it affect a user's psychology? Was the switch from Blackness to
        White GUI inevitable?

        In Glitch Studies Manifesto, Menkman disputes the meaning of a “glitch”.
        This sort of disruption of a linear path or of "normality" generally has
        a negative connotation to it. But Menkman chooses to showcase how, in
        many different states, "glitch" can highlight the discovery of a new
        form of being, how "destruction can change into the creation of
        something original.". In The Wretched of the Screen, Hito Steyerl
        discusses the importance of a "poor image". The "poor image" is a
        low-quality copy of what was an original version of the work or media
        that it portrayed. The text touches on how a poor image has been shunned
        and bastardized till some will choose to show no image at all than show
        a poor one. However, it is Steyerl's belief that a poor image is not to
        make less important the original but rather portray the ghost of the
        past. It is not meant to replace the original but be a representation
        about the existence of the original in its afterlife. Xiao Mina centres
        her discussion around memes and people, how people are important in
        every step of a meme and its definition, from creation to distribution.
        Memes, as a form of media, capture a moment of human culture and
        identity, but at the same time, the distribution and sharing of memes is
        also able to help form new culture. 1. Is "meme-culture" new? How is it
        applicable to humanity in general, not only the 21st century? 2. In what
        ways did the design of the Glitch Studies Manifesto change the impact of
        it? 3. Are memes poor images? How is it that we look at poor images and
        memes in similar ways?

        Stephanie Dinking, in "Afro-now-ism", discusses ideas of internalized
        and systemic oppression to minorities but specifically the African and
        Black community of the world. This is intertwined with our movement
        towards AI and machine technology. Afro-now-ism is about not constantly
        thinking about this "us" and "them" narrative and the loop of oppression
        and opposition. It is about looking within and seeing what you want to
        create in your heart. Joy Buolamwini discusses algorithmic bias and how
        they are so easily spreadable by simply download files from the
        internet. It was incredibly interesting to think about how much of
        algorithmic bias is based off of the data that humans input into machine
        thinking algorithms and not directly into the machine itself. This is
        also good in the aspects that we know exactly how and where to start the
        change to make code more accessible and diverse. Mimi Onuoha talks about
        data collection and how in her project Pathways, data collection is more
        critical than the data itself. She says how you should consider data
        collection as well as the data as it is because of her interactions with
        the public that caused the data to turn out in a specific way. 1. How
        does data collection play into machine learning? 2. Is there a way that
        AI is able to collect data fairly and equally? 3. Are there policies
        that can be put in place to make sure that code/algorithms are equal for
        all races, genders, etc? How would this hinder the creation of free and
        open source code?

        In "Digital Doulas Take Restorative Justice to Cyberspace", Yaa Addae
        addresses what growing up with the internet is like and how the internet
        has almost become like a parallel world, one in which the power
        structures in our society are reflected. She talks about what actions
        lead to data trauma but also how to fight that with data healing. "How
        to Write Non-Violent Creative Code" by Olivia McKayla Ross discusses how
        we can reindigenize code, specifically p5.js. This is followed by a list
        of statements that tell us to "Honor the Land", "Honor the People", etc.
        In doing so, you are recognizing that some code does not just exist,
        every part of it is connected to something else whether that be the land
        you code on or the people that made your laptop. Morehshin Allhyari in
        "On Digital Colonialism and Re-Figuring", talks about her project where
        she creates 3d printed models of artifacts destroyed by ISIS. She
        discusses the difficulty of finding data about these artifacts as well
        as the aspect of taking an artifact from the middle east and showing it
        on the internet or in-person in London. Allharyi emphasizes the
        importance of art from not just an aesthetic standpoint but also
        socially and economically motivated. 1. Can targeted ads be a positive
        influence? Are they still ethical/not ethical if so? 2. Are we writing
        non-violent code in our projects? How can we be more non-violent? 3. How
        can we apply data healing to our everyday lives?

        In "The activist dismantling racist police algorithms", Tate Ryan-Mosley
        and Jennifer Strong interview Hamid Khan about artificial intelligence
        and policing. He first talks about how the LAPD uses technology and
        specifically how police surveillance is used as a form of social control
        rather than community safety. The discussion then leads to the Stop LAPD
        Spying Coalition and it's focus on the abolition of police surveillance
        in comparison to reform. Hamid and his team have done a lot of research
        and data analysis into what data the LAPD has actually collected and
        found that the majority of the information collected is from racial
        minorites and low-income neighbourhoods. Ari Meleciano talks about
        sustainable design for the future in "Omni-Specialized Design for
        Beautiful Futures" and how designers must work with rather than for our
        environments and communities. There is a focus on questioning the
        current and past roles that design and designers have held and seeing
        how that role can change for the future. From the Cyberfeminism Indsex,
        I found "Big Bad Chinese Mama!" a website that markets itself as a "mail
        order bride" website but instead of "oriental sluts" there are "big bad
        Chinese mamas!". This website speaks loads about issues like "yellow
        fever", hypersexualization and fetishization of asian women and the drip
        down effects of colonialism. 1. We have discussed this before but how do
        you feel about the trade off of privacy for "safety"? Is there a world
        where surveillance can be used equally? Or it it inherently biased? 2.
        How is circular design already implemented in society? And where should
        it be implemented that we haven't yet thought of? 3. Do works like "Big
        Bad Chinese Mama!" or others from the Cyberfeminism Index reach the
        right audience? What is the right audience?
