[Nonnomadic](http://teen-uh.github.io/iml300/project-1) is an interactive web experience that depicts the experience of moving.

### Description

Nonnomadic depicts the journey of moving from my childhood home to a new house. Without many words, the site allows the user to explore the spaces themselves and see how all the spaces and memories are connected together. Some paths that are taken can loop back within themselves while other paths seem to only lead to one answer. Through this I hope to convey the fickle nature of memories, how they can fade and change within themselves while reality moves forward. Using a combination of found images and my own images, the pages within this site are connected in different ways. Though my first home is disconnected, with the spaces looking completely individual, my memories connect them together. I also incorporated Mandarin Chinese into the pages in an effort to make the memories seem more personal to me. While in the new home, all the images are synonymous with each other. What is lacks, however, are memories.
