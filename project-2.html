        The main components of this code are the background, the houses, the
        buttons, and the dog. For the background, I used a for-loop to generate
        a random background and then downloaded and reuploaded that as an image
        for the background using the saveCanvas function. For the houses and the
        dog, I created a function that tracks the dog's x and y coordinates and
        used and if-else function to play sound when the dog would be at a
        certain house. I then created another function that sets the instrument
        of the music from the houses. So whenever the button is clicked, the
        mode is changed and the function of that instrument will play.
        Originally I wanted to use the p5.play library
        (http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/) for the character but for
        some reason I wasn't able to get it to work since there were errors with
        some functions within the library. I was inspired in part by
        https://drawwithcode.github.io/2020-03-donatorenzulli/, where you can
        hear different songs from different apartment balconies and also Stardew
        Valley for the visuals. I liked the idea that it was like walking around
        and hearing music coming from inside the house when you're at the
        doorway.
